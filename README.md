GOL_JS
======

A simple canvas based implementation of Conway's "Game of Life".
Nothing special here. Just the basic Moore-Neighborhood algorithm.

The code is quite old, but I thought, why not share it? Think of it as a Canvas Demo ;)

It just looks nice...

Maybe I will rewrite this to accept different rulesets for the cell-evolution.

Demo see here:
